# API server
 Also known as:kube-apiserver
The API server is a component of the Kubernetes control plane that exposes the Kubernetes API. The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane.

# Cloud Controller Manager

A Kubernetes control plane component that embeds cloud-specific control logic. The cloud controller manager lets you link your cluster into your cloud provider's API,
and separates out the components that interact with that cloud platform from components that only interact with your cluster.

# CIDR

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) is a notation for describing blocks of IP addresses and is used heavily in various networking configurations.

# Controller

In Kubernetes, controllers are control loops that watch the state of your cluster, then make or request changes where needed. 
Each controller tries to move the current cluster state closer to the desired state.

# Control Plane
The container orchestration layer that exposes the API and interfaces to define, deploy, and manage the lifecycle of containers.

# Data Plane
 The layer that provides capacity such as CPU, memory, network, and storage so that the containers can run and connect to a network.
