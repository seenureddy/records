# Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)

Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) forms the foundation for routing in the Internet. More recently, BGP has made serious inroads into data centers 
on account of its scalability, extensive policy control, and proven track record of running the Internet for a few decades. Data center operators 
are known to use BGP for routing, often in different ways. Yet, because data center requirements are very different from the Internet, it is not 
straightforward to use BGP to achieve effective data center routing.
