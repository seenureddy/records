# Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)

Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) forms the foundation for routing in the Internet. More recently, BGP has made serious inroads into data centers 
on account of its scalability, extensive policy control, and proven track record of running the Internet for a few decades. Data center operators 
are known to use BGP for routing, often in different ways. Yet, because data center requirements are very different from the Internet, it is not 
straightforward to use BGP to achieve effective data center routing.


# What is an autonomous system?

The Internet is a network of networks; itâ€™s broken up into hundreds of thousands of smaller networks known as autonomous systems (AS). Each of these
networks is essentially a large pool of routers run by a single organization.
